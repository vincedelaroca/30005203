# ** Updated Since D2L **  
Please download this instead of the D2L upload. No changes were made to the code. Some files I forgot to remove, and some quick fixes to the .json file to make it work on linux. Instructions are made clear on github. Design changes also.

# Instructions

npm install  
npm run dev  
  
(just npm install should work just fine. If it doesn't, the chat uses express, moment, nodemon and socket.io)  
  
localhost:3000  
  
# Commands  
  
/name {User} -- to change username (paranthesis included)  
/color {RRGGBB} - to change username color (paranthesis included)  
  
# Not Included  

* <em>The chat log should be aligned at the bottom.</em>
